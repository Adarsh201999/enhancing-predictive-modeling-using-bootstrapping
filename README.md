# enhancing-predictive-modeling-using-bootstrapping
Focused on enhancing the reliability of predictive models, this project applies both traditional Bootstrap and Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) techniques, optimized for large datasets. We conduct a comparative analysis of BLB's efficiency and accuracy against traditional Bootstrapping technique for several regression and classification models
